## About

Bad Copy is an online video game where two players compete to sketch a reference image in 30 seconds via a virtual whiteboard. After the drawings are completed, an AI determines how accurate competitor's drawings are and gives them a percentage score out of 100. The person with the higher score is deemed the winner.

Competitors can create and join game rooms and also have the option to infinitely play against each if both players agree to play again.
